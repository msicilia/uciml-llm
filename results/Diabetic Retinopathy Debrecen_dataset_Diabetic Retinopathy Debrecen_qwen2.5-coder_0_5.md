The provided code and its output effectively demonstrate a systematic approach to selecting the best machine learning model for diabetic retinopathy classification, leveraging hyperparameter tuning and comprehensive evaluation metrics. The Gradient Boosting Classifier appears to be the best performer based on AUC-ROC score. Further exploration of feature engineering, regularization techniques, and ensemble methods could potentially lead to even better results.
