To provide a concrete example of how to run this code and interpret the output, let's assume you have the `read_dataset` function defined elsewhere in your script or in an imported module. Below is a complete example, including a mock implementation of `read_dataset`, and how you might run this code.

### Complete Example

1. **Mock Implementation of `read_dataset`**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   def read_dataset(path):
       # Mock dataset for demonstration purposes
       data = {
           'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
           'feature2': [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
           'target': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A']
       }
       return pd.DataFrame(data), pd.Series(data['target'])
   ```

2. **Main Script**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

   def main():
       # Read the dataset
       features, targets = read_dataset("./datasets/Connectionist Bench (Sonar)/")

       # Convert target to 1D array if needed
       targets = targets.values.ravel()

       # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
       X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

       # Standardize the features
       scaler = StandardScaler()
       X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
       X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

       # Initialize and train the RandomForestClassifier
       rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
       rf_classifier.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

       # Make predictions on the test set
       y_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test_scaled)

       # Calculate and print the accuracy of the model
       accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
       print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

### Running the Script

1. Save the above code in a file named `train_random_forest.py`.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`). You can install them using pip if needed:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```sh
   python train_random_forest.py
   ```

### Expected Output

The output will be something like this:
```
Accuracy: 0.95
```

This output indicates that the RandomForestClassifier achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set.

### Notes

- **Mock Dataset**: The mock dataset provided is for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with your actual dataset.
- **Accuracy**: The accuracy value will vary depending on the specific dataset and its characteristics. The RandomForestClassifier should provide a reasonable level of performance given a well-preprocessed dataset.

This complete example demonstrates how to read a dataset, preprocess it, train a RandomForestClassifier, and evaluate its performance using accuracy as the metric.
