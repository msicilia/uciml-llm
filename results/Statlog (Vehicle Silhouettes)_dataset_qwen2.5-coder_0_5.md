The provided Python code demonstrates how to evaluate the performance of several machine learning classifiers on a dataset using cross-validation. Here's a breakdown of the steps and considerations:

### Steps in the Code:
1. **Load Dataset**: The dataset is loaded using a custom function `read_dataset`.
2. **Target Conversion**: The target variable is converted to a 1D array.
3. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio.
4. **Feature Scaling**: The features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance computations made by the classifiers.
5. **Classifier Training and Evaluation**:
   - Four different classifiers (SVC, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier) are trained on the scaled training data.
   - Predictions are made on the scaled test data.
   - Accuracy scores are calculated and printed for each classifier.

### Potential Improvements and Considerations:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model. For example, you can use `GridSearchCV` from `sklearn.model_selection`.

2. **Cross-Validation**:
   - Instead of a single train-test split, consider using k-fold cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of each model's performance.

3. **Feature Selection/Engineering**:
   - Analyze and possibly engineer features to improve model performance. This might involve techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), feature scaling, or selecting relevant features.

4. **Handling Class Imbalance**:
   - If your dataset has class imbalance, consider using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

5. **Model Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Besides accuracy, consider other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC score to get a more comprehensive view of model performance.

### Example with Grid Search and Cross-Validation:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
features, targets = read_dataset("./datasets/Statlog (Vehicle Silhouettes)/")

# Convert targets to 1d arrays if necessary
targets = targets.values.ravel()

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Apply feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Define classifiers
classifiers = {
    "SVC": SVC(),
    "K-Nearest Neighbors": KNeighborsClassifier(),
    "Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression(max_iter=200),
    "Random Forest Classifier": RandomForestClassifier()
}

for name, classifier in classifiers.items():
    # Grid search for hyperparameter tuning
    param_grid = {
        'C': [0.1, 1, 10],
        'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'],
        'gamma': [1, 0.1, 0.01]
    }
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=classifier, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5)
    grid_search.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

    # Best model
    best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_

    # Cross-validation
    cross_val_accuracy = cross_val_score(best_model, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv=5).mean()

    # Predictions on test set
    y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test_scaled)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    print(f"{name}: Best Hyperparameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
    print(f"{name}: Cross-Validation Accuracy: {cross_val_accuracy:.4f}")
    print(f"{name}: Test Set Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}\n")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Grid Search**:
   - `GridSearchCV` is used to perform grid search for hyperparameter tuning. It exhaustively searches over specified parameter values for each estimator.

2. **Cross-Validation**:
   - `cross_val_score` is used to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance by performing cross-validation.

3. **Best Model**:
   - The best model found during grid search is used for predictions on the test set and evaluation.

By incorporating these improvements, you can achieve better model performance and gain a deeper understanding of your dataset and models.
