```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
features, targets = read_dataset("./datasets/Wine Quality/")

# Display the first few rows of the features dataframe
print(features.head())

# Display the target distribution
print(targets.value_counts().sort_index())
```

This will give you a good starting point to understand your data. The `read_dataset` function is assumed to be a custom function that loads the dataset from the specified path. Once the data is loaded, it's a good practice to explore the data by printing out the first few rows and understanding the distribution of the target variable.

Next, let's preprocess the data by encoding the categorical variable and splitting it into training and testing sets:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Encode the 'color' column using one-hot encoding
features_encoded = pd.get_dummies(features, columns=['color'], drop_first=True)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_encoded, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Now that your data is preprocessed, you can proceed to select and train a classification model. For this dataset, I'll choose the Random Forest Classifier due to its robustness and ability to handle multiple features:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Initialize the Random Forest Classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
```

This code initializes a Random Forest Classifier with 100 trees and trains it on the training data. It then makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model using accuracy score and a classification report.

Finally, if necessary, you can try other models or tune hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. However, for this initial attempt, the Random Forest Classifier should provide a good starting point.
