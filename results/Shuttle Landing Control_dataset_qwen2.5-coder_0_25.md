It looks like you provided a detailed Python script for training a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on a dataset and evaluating its performance. The script includes steps such as loading the data, handling missing values, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, scaling the features, training the model, and finally evaluating its accuracy.

Here is a breakdown of the key parts of the script:

1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   ```python
   features, targets = read_dataset("./datasets/Shuttle Landing Control/")
   ```

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   ```python
   targets = targets.values.ravel()
   features.dropna(inplace=True)
   targets = targets[~features.isnull().any(axis=1)]
   ```

3. **Splitting the Dataset**:
   ```python
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

4. **Scaling the Features**:
   ```python
   scaler = StandardScaler()
   X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
   X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
   ```

5. **Training the Model**:
   ```python
   model = GaussianNB()
   model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
   ```

6. **Evaluating the Model**:
   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
   ```

This script is well-structured and follows best practices for machine learning in Python using scikit-learn. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with the script, feel free to ask!
