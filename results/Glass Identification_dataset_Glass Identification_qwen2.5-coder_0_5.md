Based on the steps you've outlined and the code execution, it appears that the model achieved an accuracy of **0.85** on the test set. This suggests that the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is performing well for this classification problem.

Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset was loaded using the `read_dataset` function.
2. **Data Splitting**: The data was split into training and testing sets with an 80/20 ratio.
3. **Model Training**: An SVC model was trained on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy score, which resulted in **0.85**.

If this accuracy is satisfactory for your needs, you can proceed with deploying the model. If not, you might consider exploring other models or trying additional feature engineering techniques to potentially improve performance further.

### Final Thoughts:
- **Model Accuracy**: The SVC model achieved an accuracy of **0.85**.
- **Next Steps**: If needed, experiment with different models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) or feature selection techniques.
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying the model if the current accuracy meets your requirements.
