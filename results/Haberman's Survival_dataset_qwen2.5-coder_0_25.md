```py
# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Print the predicted survival statuses
print("Predicted Survival Statuses:\n", y_pred)
```

To further improve the model, you can consider the following steps:

1. **Feature Selection**: Evaluate and select the most relevant features for the model.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to find the best hyperparameters for your model.
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models using ensemble methods like Bagging, Boosting, or Stacking to potentially improve performance.
4. **Different Algorithms**: Try different classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), and Neural Networks.

Here is an example of how you can perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search:

```py
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'gamma': [1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001],
    'kernel': ['rbf']
}

# Initialize the GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(SVC(), param_grid, refit=True, verbose=2)

# Train the model with grid search
grid_search.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Get the best parameters and the best score
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
best_score = grid_search.best_score_

print("Best Parameters:", best_params)
print("Best Score:", best_score)

# Use the best model for predictions
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
y_pred_best = best_model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the best model's performance on the testing data
accuracy_best = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_best)
report_best = classification_report(y_test, y_pred_best)

print("Accuracy with Best Model:", accuracy_best)
print("Classification Report with Best Model:\n", report_best)
```
