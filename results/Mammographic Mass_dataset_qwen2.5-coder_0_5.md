To provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance, we need to input the actual values for each metric. Without these specific numbers, it's challenging to make detailed observations and recommendations.

Here is an example format to input the metrics:

```
### Logistic Regression:
- **Accuracy**: [value]
- **Precision**: [value]
- **Recall**: [value]
- **F1-Score**: [value]

### Random Forest:
- **Accuracy**: [value]
- **Precision**: [value]
- **Recall**: [value]
- **F1-Score**: [value]
```

Please provide the specific values for each metric so I can assist you further in analyzing and interpreting the model performance.
