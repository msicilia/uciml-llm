Thoughts:
The provided code demonstrates a basic approach to building a spam detection model for YouTube comments using scikit-learn. The steps include reading the dataset, preprocessing the text data, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluating its accuracy on the test set. This method can be further refined by experimenting with different feature extraction techniques, model architectures, and hyperparameters to potentially improve performance.

The final output of the code will display the accuracy of the spam detection model on the test dataset, providing a quantitative measure of how well the model performs in distinguishing between spam and non-spam comments.
