Thought: The initial attempt to train a Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of around 0.75. This is reasonably good but not exceptional. Let's try another model to see if we can improve the performance.

We will use a Random Forest Classifier, which is known for its robustness and effectiveness in handling various types of data. We'll also perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for our model.

Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Read the dataset
features, targets = read_dataset("./datasets/Post-Operative Patient/")

# Convert target to 1D array
targets = targets.values.ravel()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the Random Forest Classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# Define the hyperparameter grid to search
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

# Perform grid search for hyperparameter tuning
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the best model from the grid search
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_

# Evaluate the best model on the testing set
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, best_model.predict(X_test))
print("Best Model Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
