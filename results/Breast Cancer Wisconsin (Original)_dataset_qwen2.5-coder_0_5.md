The provided code snippet is a Python script that performs the following tasks:

1. **Reading the Dataset**: It imports the necessary libraries and reads the dataset using a function `read_dataset()` from an unspecified module. The dataset should have features (input variables) and target variable.

2. **Handling Missing Data**: It uses the `SimpleImputer` from `sklearn.impute` to fill in any missing values in the 'Bare_nuclei' column of the dataset with the mean of the non-missing values in that column.

3. **Feature Scaling**: The dataset is scaled using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance computations in algorithms like SVM.

4. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` function from `sklearn.model_selection`, with a test size of 20% (80% for training and 20% for testing).

5. **Model Initialization and Training**: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is initialized with a linear kernel and a regularization parameter C=1, and then it is trained on the training data.

6. **Prediction and Evaluation**: The model makes predictions on the test set using the `predict()` method. It then calculates and prints four key performance metrics:
   - **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
   - **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
   - **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
   - **F1-Score**: A weighted average of Precision and Recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst at 0.

This script is a complete example of building a simple machine learning model using SVM on a dataset with some preprocessing steps.
