The provided code outlines a comprehensive workflow for building, training, evaluating, and validating a machine learning model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with a pipeline that includes standard scaling. Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - The `read_dataset` function is called to load the dataset into `features` and `targets`.

2. **Exploring the Data**:
   - `features.head()` and `targets.head()` are used to print the first few rows of the features and targets respectively, giving an overview of the data structure.
   - `print(features.isnull().sum())` and `print(targets.isnull().sum())` check for any missing values in the dataset.

3. **Splitting the Dataset**:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`, where 70% of the data is used for training (`test_size=0.3`) and the remaining 30% is used for testing.

4. **Creating a Pipeline**:
   - A pipeline is created with two steps: `StandardScaler` to scale the features, and `SVC` (Support Vector Classifier) as the classifier.
   
5. **Training the Model**:
   - The model is trained on the training data using `pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)`.

6. **Evaluating the Model**:
   - The model's performance is evaluated on the test data using `y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)`, followed by calculating and printing the accuracy score and classification report.

7. **Cross-Validation**:
   - Cross-validation is performed to get a better estimate of the model's performance using `cv_scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, features, targets, cv=5)`. The average of these scores is printed along with individual scores.

This code is structured to ensure that each step in the machine learning pipeline is clearly defined and executed, providing a robust framework for building, evaluating, and validating machine learning models.

Here's the complete code again for reference:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load the dataset
features, targets = read_dataset("./datasets/Vertebral Column.csv")

# Explore the data
print(features.head())
print(targets.head())

# Check for missing values
print("Missing values in features:", features.isnull().sum())
print("Missing values in targets:", targets.isnull().sum())

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create a pipeline with standard scaler and SVM classifier
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('svm', SVC(random_state=42))
])

# Train the model on the training data
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the test data
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Classification Report:")
print(report)

# Use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance
cv_scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, features, targets, cv=5)
print(f"Cross-Validation Scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Average Cross-Validation Score: {cv_scores.mean()}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Loading the Dataset**: The `read_dataset` function is used to load the dataset from a CSV file.
- **Exploring the Data**: Basic checks and prints are done to understand the data.
- **Splitting the Dataset**: The dataset is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
- **Creating a Pipeline**: A pipeline is created using `Pipeline` from `sklearn.pipeline`, which includes scaling the features with `StandardScaler` and then applying an SVM classifier.
- **Training the Model**: The model is trained on the training data.
- **Evaluating the Model**: The model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and metrics like accuracy and a classification report are printed.
- **Cross-Validation**: Cross-validation with 5 folds is performed to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

This code provides a clear and detailed workflow for building a machine learning model using SVM with standard scaling.
