To summarize the detailed steps and the provided Python script for building an SVM classifier using the ISOLET dataset, here is a concise overview:

1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, splitting, scaling, model training, and evaluation.
2. **Load Dataset**: Use a custom function `read_dataset` to load the ISOLET dataset into features (`X`) and targets (`y`).
3. **Split Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` with an 80-20 split ratio and set a random state for reproducibility.
4. **Preprocess Features**: Scale the feature data using `StandardScaler` to ensure each feature has zero mean and unit variance.
5. **Train Model**: Create and train an SVM classifier with a linear kernel on the scaled training data.
6. **Evaluate Model**: Make predictions on the scaled test data and calculate the accuracy score and classification report to evaluate the model's performance.

This script provides a clear and structured approach to building a machine learning model for the ISOLET dataset using an SVM classifier.
