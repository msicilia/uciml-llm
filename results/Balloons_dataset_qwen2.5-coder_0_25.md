### System:
An agent tried to answer a user query but it got stuck and failed to do so. You are tasked with providing an answer instead. Here is the agent's memory:

### User:
New task:
You are an experienced data scientist.
 
We want to build a classification model for the following problem. 

This is the description of the dataset
Data previously used in cognitive psychology experiment; 4 data sets represent different conditions of an experiment
There are four data sets representing different conditions of an experiment. All have the same attributes.

a. adult-stretch.data  Inflated is true if age=adult or act=stretch

b. adult+stretch.data  Inflated is true if age=adult and act=stretch

c. small-yellow.data   Inflated is true if (color=yellow and size = small) or

d. small-yellow+adult-stretch.data  Inflated is true if (color=yellow and size = small) or (age=adult and act=stretch)

And here is the description of each of the features in the dataset.
|    | name     | role    | type        | demographic   |   description |   units | missing_values   |
|---:|:---------|:--------|:------------|:--------------|--------------:|--------:|:-----------------|
|  0 | color    | Feature | Categorical | nan           |           nan |     nan | no               |
|  1 | size     | Feature | Categorical | nan           |           nan |     nan | no               |
|  2 | act      | Feature | Categorical | nan           |           nan |     nan | no               |
|  3 | age      | Feature | Categorical | Age           |           nan |     nan | no               |
|  4 | inflated | Target  | Categorical | nan           |           nan |     nan | no               |

You can read the dataset using the call to the appropriate tool:

features, targets = read_dataset("./datasets/Balloons/")

This returns two dataframes, remember to convert targets to 1d arrays when necessary

Find a classification model that is good enough using scikit-learn for the following dataset
and provide the code you used. 
Do not use visualizations, that is, do not use matplotlib, seaborn or other plotting libraries.


### Assistant:
Thought: To build a classification model for this dataset, we need to:
1. Read the dataset.
2. Convert the target variable to a 1D array if necessary.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Choose an appropriate classification algorithm.
5. Train the model on the training data.
6. Make predictions on the testing data.
7. Evaluate the model's performance.

Let's proceed with using a Random Forest classifier, which is often effective for multi-class classification problems.

Code:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Initialize a Random Forest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```<end_code>
Calling tools:
[{'id': 'call_1', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': 'from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n# Initialize a Random Forest classifier\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n\n# Train the model on the training data\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions on the testing data\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate the model\'s performance\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")'}}]
