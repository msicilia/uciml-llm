The provided code snippet outlines a complete workflow for building and evaluating a RandomForestClassifier on a dataset containing features related to breast cancer. The steps include:

1. **Reading the Dataset**: 
   - The function `read_dataset` is used to load the data, which returns `features` and `targets`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Target Conversion**: The target variable is converted to a 1D array using `values.ravel()`.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: The missing values in the 'Bare_nuclei' column are handled by filling them with the median of the non-missing values in that column.

3. **Splitting the Data**:
   - The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`. 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% is used for testing.

4. **Feature Scaling**:
   - The features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is important for many machine learning algorithms, especially those that rely on distance metrics like KNN or SVM.

5. **Model Training**:
   - A RandomForestClassifier with 100 trees (`n_estimators=100`) is instantiated and trained on the scaled training data.

6. **Prediction and Evaluation**:
   - The model makes predictions on the test set using `model.predict(X_test_scaled)`.
   - The accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels (`y_test`), and the result is printed in a formatted string.

This workflow demonstrates a practical application of RandomForest for binary classification problems, highlighting steps such as data cleaning, preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.
