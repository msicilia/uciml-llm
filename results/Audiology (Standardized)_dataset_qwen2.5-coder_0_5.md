This code provides a basic framework for building and evaluating a Random Forest classifier on a dataset named "Audiology (Standardized)". The script performs the following steps:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: It assumes that there is a function `read_dataset` which reads the dataset from a specified path and returns the features and targets.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The targets are converted to a 1D array if they are not already in this format, which is often required by scikit-learn models.

3. **Splitting Data**: The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn. The test set size is set to 20% of the total dataset, and a random state is fixed for reproducibility.

4. **Model Initialization and Training**: A Random Forest Classifier is initialized with 100 trees (`n_estimators=100`). It does not limit the maximum depth of the trees (`max_depth=None`) and uses the default minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (`min_samples_split=2`). The classifier is then trained on the training data.

5. **Prediction and Evaluation**: The model makes predictions on the test set, and the accuracy and a detailed classification report are printed. The classification report provides metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

This script serves as a starting point for building and evaluating machine learning models using scikit-learn. You can extend this by tuning hyperparameters, using different classifiers, or incorporating additional preprocessing steps as needed.
