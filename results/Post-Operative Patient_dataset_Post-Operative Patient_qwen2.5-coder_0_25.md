It seems like there's been a misunderstanding or an error in the instructions. The provided code snippet is a complete script to load a dataset, preprocess it using one-hot encoding, split it into training and testing sets, train a Random Forest Classifier, make predictions, and calculate the accuracy of those predictions.

However, if you're encountering issues such as "module not found" errors or similar, it's important to ensure that all necessary libraries are installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

If you have a specific error message or issue, please provide more details so I can assist you further.

Here is the complete code snippet again for reference:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
features, targets = read_dataset("./datasets/Post-Operative Patient/")

# Separate the target variable
target = targets['ADM-DECS'].values

# Apply one-hot encoding to the features
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
encoded_features = encoder.fit_transform(features)

# Convert the encoded features back to a DataFrame
import pandas as pd
encoded_df = pd.DataFrame(encoded_features, columns=encoder.get_feature_names_out())

# Concatenate the one-hot encoded features with the 'COMFORT' column
final_features = pd.concat([encoded_df, features['COMFORT']], axis=1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(final_features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the Random Forest Classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

Make sure to replace `read_dataset("./datasets/Post-Operative Patient/")` with the actual function or method you use to load your dataset.
