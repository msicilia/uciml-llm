Thought: Now that we have preprocessed the dataset and selected a suitable classification model, let's proceed with training and evaluating it.

We will use a Random Forest Classifier for this task due to its robustness and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.

Code:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the classifier on the training data
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Classification Report:")
print(report)
```
