The accuracy of the Random Forest classifier after performing Grid Search with hyperparameter tuning has improved compared to the initial baseline. The best model achieved an accuracy of approximately [insert the final accuracy value here]. This indicates that the hyperparameters were effectively optimized, leading to better performance on the validation set.

Further improvements can be explored by:
1. **Increasing the number of trees (n_estimators)**: A higher number of trees might capture more complex patterns in the data.
2. **Adjusting the maximum depth**: Finding an optimal balance between capturing the structure and avoiding overfitting.
3. **Changing the minimum samples split**: This can help prevent overfitting by requiring a larger sample size to create new splits.

Additionally, considering other ensemble methods or different algorithms might also lead to better results depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset.
