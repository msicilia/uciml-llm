It seems there was an issue with the previous response. Let's retry running the code in a clean environment.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assuming you have already read the dataset into features and targets
# Convert targets to 1D array if necessary
targets = targets.values.flatten()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize a RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# You can tune the hyperparameters or try other classifiers to improve performance if needed
```

This code should give you an accuracy score for your model. If it still doesn't work, please make sure that the `features` and `targets` variables are correctly defined in your environment before running this code.
