The provided code successfully classifies the ISOLET dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVC) with a linear kernel in scikit-learn. The pipeline includes loading and preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, standardizing the features, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating its accuracy.

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded using `read_dataset("./datasets/ISOLET/")`. This function is assumed to handle the loading process.

2. **Converting Targets to 1D Array**: The target variable is converted to a 1D array using `targets.values.ravel()`.

3. **Splitting Data**: The data is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio using `train_test_split`.

4. **Standardizing Features**: The features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that each feature has zero mean and unit variance.

5. **Choosing a Model**: A Support Vector Machine (SVC) with a linear kernel is chosen as the classification model.

6. **Training the Model**: The model is trained on the scaled training data using `model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`.

7. **Making Predictions**: Predictions are made on the scaled testing set using `y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)`.

8. **Evaluating the Model**: The accuracy of the model is evaluated using `accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)` and printed to the console.

The final output will be the accuracy of the model:

```
Accuracy: 0.xxxx
```

You can further experiment with different models and hyperparameters to improve performance if needed.
