We want to build a classification model for the following problem. 

This is the description of the dataset
{abstract}
{summary}

And here is the description of each of the features in the dataset.
{feature_desc}

You can read the dataset using the call to the appropriate tool:

features, targets = read_dataset("{path}")

This returns two dataframes, remember to convert targets to 1d arrays when necessary

Find a classification model that is good enough using scikit-learn for the following dataset
and provide the code you used. 
Do not use visualizations, that is, do not use matplotlib, seaborn or other plotting libraries.
